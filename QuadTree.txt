Divide face - store in face array
Loop through array and generate using ConstructMesh() in GenerateMesh() in Planet.cs
Decide resolution of mesh based on distance to player - Calculated in the TerrainFace.cs?
Take into account planet radius? Make sure to normalise

Maybe try checking if face is within view/line of sight
